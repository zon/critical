### Software Quality Mediation

Is hyperbolic to say that code quality is one of the most important issues of this century? We don't just want good software. We need it. Never the less we continue to produce sub-par code. Managers and business owners often can't see that they are being given poor work. Developers often toil unrecognized in obscurity. There's something wrong with how we produce software.

Everyone wants to make great software. There's tremendous pressure prove yourself and to deliver quickly. There's an incentive to push projects forward even if there are latent quality problems. Critical offers impartial code reviews to help insure things are done properly. We help projects maintain momentum by finding problems before they become serious.
